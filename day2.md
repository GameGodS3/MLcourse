<h2>Neurons In brain</h2>
  <h4>Cells within the nervous system, called neurons, communicate with each other in unique ways. The neuron is the basic working unit of the brain, a specialized cell designed to transmit information to other nerve cells, muscle, or gland cells.
    
The brain is what it is because of the structural and functional properties of interconnected neurons. The mammalian brain contains between 100 million and 100 billion neurons, depending on the species.

<h2>okay,now let's revise Supervised and unsupervised learning!</h2>
</br>

<h2>Neural Networks and perceptrons</h2>
<h4>Perceptron is a single layer neural network and a multi-layer perceptron is called Neural Networks.</h4>
Perceptron is a linear classifier (binary). Also, it is used in supervised learning
</br>But how does it work?
The perceptron works on these simple steps

</br>a. All the inputs x are multiplied with their weights w. Letâ€™s call it k.

</br>b. Add all the multiplied values and call them Weighted Sum.

</br>c. Apply that weighted sum to the correct Activation Function.
</br>For Example : Unit Step Activation Function.

<h2>Overfitting</h2>
</br>Overfitting is when the trained model memorizes the undesirable patterns or noise from the training data-set. This is due to too much training or learning capacity(too many hidden layers or neurons in each layer). The consequence of overfitting is that, model cannot generalize to samples outside its training set, which overall reduces the performance of the model. To determine whether the model is overfitting, during the training, compare the loss value on the training and testing set. If the loss on the test set is much larger than in the training set, then the model is overfitting, specially if the training loss is low. However, it is also normal that the test loss is slightly larger than training loss.
